            This demo shows off flocking with gravity and the y-axis lock turned off. The prefab agent is
            <code>/SteeringBehaviors/Prefabs/bird</code>, and the example scene is
            <code>/SteeringBehaviors/Scenes/birds</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This concludes the behavior and framework tutorials. This is a demo that uses the previous behaviors in new
            and interesting ways.

        <h2>Birds/Antigravity Flocking</h2>
        <p>
            This demo gets a little... weird? It is the same as the original flocking demo, but the gravity on each
            agent is turned off and the steering manager allows for force to be applied in the y direction. As a result
            we get agents flocking in mid-air.
        </p>

            Other than just looking strange (mostly due to the model choice), it could also be useful in creating
            simulations of birds. To take this further, one could add agents on the ground that get attacked (using
            seek) by the birds, and then within the bird flocks themselves they could try to steal from each other.
