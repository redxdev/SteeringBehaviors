        <h1>Steering Behaviors</h1>
        <p>
            This site is an information and tutorial site centered around steering behaviors and an accompanying
            <a href="https://github.com/redxdev/SteeringBehaviors">unity project</a>. The project and this site were
            created in the fall of 2014 in the School of Interactive Games and Media by Sam Bloomberg. Both the project
            and website are under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>.

        <p>
            The goal of the unity project is twofold: First, to create a simple framework for writing steering
            behaviors for autonomous agents in such a way that one has to do minimal to no scripting in order to
            use a behavior, or even to combine behaviors. The second goal is to create a set of example behaviors that
            can be either used inside other projects or just used as reference implementations of common behaviors.

            Use the navigation bar at the top to explore the different behaviors included in the project. Each page
            includes both a demo in Unity and an explaination of how the behavior works.
