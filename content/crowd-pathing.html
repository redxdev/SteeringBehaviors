        This demo shows off a combination of flocking and path following behaviors. The prefab agent is
        <code>/SteeringBehaviors/Prefabs/crowd</code>, and the example scene is
        <code>/SteeringBehaviors/Scenes/crowd pathing</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This concludes the behavior and framework tutorials. This is a demo that uses the previous behaviors in new and
        interesting ways.

    <h2>Crowd Path Following</h2>
    <p>
        To simulate a group of people following a path, we can use both the path following and flocking behaviors on a
        single agent. After playing around with the weights and other settings, you end up with a demo such as above.
